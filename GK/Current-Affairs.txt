1) Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP)
- The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act in India came into existence in 1971. It was amended in 2003 to facilitate better implementation and increase access for women especially in the private health sector. However, even four decades after the Act came into effect, unsafe abortions are a reality.
- This act allows non-allopathic medical practitioners like ayurveda and homoeopathy specialists and paramedics like nurses and midwives to perform MTP's.


2) IRNSS-1C
- It's a 27th consecutive success mission of the Indian Space Research Organization’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle launched the IRNSS -1C, the third in a series of seven Indian Regional Navigation Satellite Systems from Sriharikota.
- The launch of the 1425 kg IRNSS-1C on board the PSLV-C26 was carried out at 1.32 am from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, ISRO said in an official statement.
- “After a flight of about 20 minutes 18 seconds, IRNSS-1C Satellite, weighing 1425 kg, was injected to an elliptical orbit of 282.56 km X 20,670 km, which is very close to the intended orbit,’’ ISRO said.
- The first two satellites in the IRNSS series 1A and 1B were launched on the PSLV on July 02, 2013 and April 04, 2014 respectively. These satellites are functioning satisfactorily, ISRO said.
- The IRNSS is an independent regional navigation satellite system designed by ISRO to provide GPS type positioning  information in the Indian region and 1500 km around the Indian mainland.“ IRNSS would provide two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Services (SPS) – provided to all users – and Restricted Services (RS), provided to authorised users,’’ ISRO said.
- “A number of ground stations responsible for the generation and transmission of navigation parameters, satellite control, satellite ranging and monitoring, etc., have been established in as many as 15 locations across the country,’’ ISRO said.
- The next satellite in the series the IRNSS-1D is scheduled to be launched by PSLV by the end of the year. The entire IRNSS constellation of seven satellites is proposed to be put in place by 2015.

5) Dengue Vaccine
- Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an "Aedes aegypti" mosquito infected with a dengue virus.
- France-based drugmaker "Sanofi Pasteur" has announced the world's first dengue vaccine could come in the second half of 2015.
- Overall efficacy against any symptomatic dengue disease was 60.8 percent in children and adolescents between ages 9 and 16 who received three doses of the vaccine. Analysis had shown a 95.5 per cent protection against severe dengue and an 80.3 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization during the study.
- Why is a dengue vaccine needed ? Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a virus, with four strains. The mortality associated with the virus is seen from the complication called Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF), characterised by sharp drop in platelets. With no specific treatment available for this condition, the management of dengue has been largely preventive, through anti-mosquito activities, ro symptomatic, where doctors treat patients for the symptoms.
- How will the vaccine work ? Sanofi Pasteur's tetravalent vaccine has been made with live attenuates of each strain of virus in a restricted and controlled amount, which is expected to just trigger body's immune response system to a level where immunity is developed, but the strain does not actually cause the disease. When the body encounters the virus in the atmosphere, it is expected that the immunity which has been exposed to the virus in controlled amount, will trigger the same protective response system.
- How big a threat is dengue to India ? According to WHO, dengue threatens over 2.5 billion people worldwide, including an estimated 500,000 who are hospitalized every year from the disease. Between 2 and 3 of every 100 people who contract dengue end up dying from it. According to large study published in 2013, in 2010, an estimated third of all dengue infections were in India, and the situation has worsened since. According to Health Ministry data, the number of dengue cases jumped 500 percent from 12,561 in 2008 to 75,808 in 2013, while the number of deaths from the disease more than doubled from 80 in 2008 to 193 in 2013. Western and southern India, Delhi and West Bengal are the dengue hotspots in India. In 2013 most cases were reported in Kerala(7,938), followed by Orris(7,132) and Karnataka(6,408). The most deaths, however, occured in Maharashtra(48), followed by Kerala(29) and Punjab(25). Both the disease and deaths are, however, suspected to be under-reported, and some experts feel the incidence of dengue in India could be up to 300 times higher.

8) Canal Solar Power Project
 - The Canal Solar Power Project is a project launched in Gujarat, to use 19,000 Kilometre long network of Narmada canals across the state for setting up solar panels to generate electricity. The 10 Megawatt project is situated on the Narmada branch canal near Chandrasan village of Kadi taluka in Mehsana district. The pilot project will generate 1.6 million units of clean energy per annum and also prevent evaporation of 9 million litres of water annually from the canal. The project virtually eliminates the requirement to acquire vast tracts of land and limits evaporation of water from the 750 meter long canal, tackling two challenges simultaneously by providing energy and water security.
 - It is 3.5 kilometre-long country's biggest 10-MW canal-top solar power project. A total 483 solar tablets of 6.5X2.3 metres have been laid along the canal top which promises clean and green energy.
	

9) Basmati rice variety
 - Pusa-1509 a basmati rice variety. Pusa-1509's advantage is its yield. The average 25 quintals paddy per acre from the variety are away above 10 quintals from tradition basmati varities such as Taraori and Deharaduni. It surpasses even the 20 quintals for Pusa-1121. 
 - Both Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509 have lower plang heights than the 160 cm levels for traditional basmatis, making them more responsible to fertiliser applications. The Pusa-1509 plant is only 80 cm tall, below even the 120 cm for Pusa-1121.
 - But the yield is not sole attraction. Pusa-1509 matures within 120 days while Pusa-1121 matures within 145 days.


10) Problems associated with megalopolis (very big cities)
 - Polluted rivers hence depends entirely on water released by neighbouring states - resulting in shortages that reach alarming proportion each summer. Its water table remains among the most deficient in the country, even though it does not have to meet irrigation demands.
 - A sewage system built 80 years ago is now on its last legs, even as open defecation along the river continues.
 - Road carries the highest number of vehicle.
 - Concepts like segregation and recycling of waste, solar photo-voltaics on rooftops and the use of technology-based solutions are not part of vocabulary.


11) Vehicle import policy
- The permission has been sought from Director General of Foreign Trade(DGFT) because, as per the import policy, a second hand or used vehicle can be imported only against authorisation.
- The import such of vehicle is subject to the condition that it "shall not be older than three years from the date of manufacture; have a right hand steering, and controls (applicable on vehicles other than tow and three wheelers); have a speedometer indicating the speed in kilometres".
- Currently, import of vehicles by foreign diplomats and other belongings to this category exempt from payment of custom duty. However, private citizens and other individuals have to pay a duty of over 100 per cent for importing used vehicle. 


12) Amendments in Indian Penal Code

- Section 304A: Maximum punishment of 10 years, from existing two, for rash and negligent driving resulting in death.
- Section 309: To decriminalise "attempt to suicide", this section will be dropped completely. The particular section contains a provision that prescribed one year jail as punishment to for those attempting to commit suicide.


13) Gujarat compulsory vote law
- Several legal experts questioned the constitutionality and workability of the law that was blocked by former Gujarat governor Kamla Beniwal for several years before it was cleared by Governor O P Kohli recently and was notified in the state gazette on November 5.
- Rules under the amended law are, however, yet to be framed, and the penalty for not voting is still to be notified.
- The act has a procedure to identify a "defaulter voter", the election officer may declare the voter to be the defaulter voter who failed to vote after giving him a notice in the form prescribed by rules. The voter will have a month to reply, giving valid and sufficient reasons for not voting, along with supporting documents like a medical certificate or a copy of passport. If the reply is late, or the reason not satisfactory, the election office will declare the voter a "defaulter".
- Valid grounds for not voting include physical incapability due to illness or other bodily infirmity; being absent from Gujarat or India on the date of election; other grounds prescribed by the state government in consultation with the State Election Commission.
- In enacting the law, government has amended three older Acts. Compulsory voting in municipal corporation, municipality and panchayat polls has been included under 'Obligation to Vote', while inserting sub-sections to relevant sections of the three earlier Acts.
- However, the law will come into effect only after the state government has issued separate notifications related to provisions such as punishment for the voter who defaults.
- An indications of likely punishment was given in 2010 by an official who helped draft the bill: "we are mulling punitive action withdrawing BPL cards, and discontinuing government subsidy on kerosene and cooking gas.
- Former governor Kamal Beniwal has said forcing a voter was "against the principles of individual libery", and violated freedoms guaranteed under Article 21.

17) A Rocky Landing
- European Space Agency's lander, Philae, was successfully launched from the Rosetta spacecraft and was fast dropping towards the comet 67P/Churymov-Gerasimenko. The historic mission is the first time anyone has attempted to land a spacecraft on a comet.
- For the next seven hours, Philae will descend 22 km, reaching its target on the "head" of the comet around 4pm GMT.
- ROSETTA WHO: Launched in March 2004, Rosetta was reactivated after a record 957 days in hibernation. Composed of an orbiter and lander, Rosetta's objectives are to study comet 67P in unprecedented detail, using its 21 scientific instruments to study how the comet reacts to a close encounter within sun. The resulting data will help scientists learn more about the origin and evolution of our solar system and the role comets may have played in seeding Earth with water, and perhaps even life.
- THE COMET 67P: Rosetta made history in August when it entered 67P's orbit. Surface temperature go down to minus 70 degrees and the terrain is uneven, making for a rough landing.
- THE MISSION: The first phase will last tow-and-a-half days where Philae will be on primary battery power. In phase two, which will use solar power for approximately three months. Its goal is stick which the comet until it passes the sun in August 1025.
- LANDING PHILAE: The landing site - previously known as "Site J" is named Agilkia. As it approaches the 67P, Philae will fire a set of harpoons and tether itself to the frozen surface.
- THE FAMOUS SELFIES: The Comet Infrared and Visible Analyser (CIVA) on Philae is comprised of seven cameras that are capable of taking 360 degree photos of the comet's landscape once the spacecraft lands. On September 7, Rosetta took a selfie with CIVA camera from a distance of 50 km from the comet.
- THE NUMBERS: 100 kg - weight of probe; 10 feet long - length of Rosetta; 2 wing-like solar panels; 6 billion km - distance travelled to reach comet; 10 years - time taken; $1.68 billion - cost of Rosetta mission; 75% - scientist's estimate of chance of a successful landing
- The COMET itself is about 2.5 Miles (4 KM) long and orbits the sun every six-and-ad half years.
