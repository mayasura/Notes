## FDI norms for construction ##
- The government on Wednesday relaxed the foreign direct investment (FDI) norms for the construction development sector further by easing exit norms and reducing built-up area and capital needs. The move comes amid the Prime Minister’s Office recently expressing the need to liberalise end-use restrictions on external commercial borrowing (ECB) proceeds for infrastructure financing.
- The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) said that the minimum floor requirement has been reduced to 20,000 square metre from 50,000 square metre while the minimum capitalisation has been reduced to $5 million from $10 million.
- These provisions were approved by the Cabinet in October in order to give a leg-up to the plan of developing 100 smart cities in the country. In case of development of serviced plots, the condition of minimum land of 10 hectares has been completely removed, the consolidated FDI policy circular 2014 said.
- As first reported by The Indian Express, the industry department has also made exit easy for foreign investors by doing away with the condition of three-year lock-in period.
- As per the earlier rule, investors were permitted to exit on completion of the project or after three years from the date of final investment, subject to development of trunk infrastructure, which includes roads, water supply, street lighting, drainage and sewerage.
- Although 100 per cent foreign direct investment was allowed in townships, housing and built-up infrastructure and construction developments since 2005, certain conditions were imposed for investment in the sector.
- The move will also give a thrust to the government’s plan of providing housing to all Indians by 2022. To boost the development of affordable homes, government has exempted the conditions of minimum floor area as well as capital requirement if an investee/joint venture companies commit at least 30 per cent of the total project cost for low-cost housing. According to the National Housing Bank estimate, India needs about 19 million homes to house an urban population expected to nearly double to 600 million by 2030 from 2011.


## Kisan Vikas Patra(KVP) ##
- The KVP was originally launched from April 1, 1988 and over the years accounted for nearly 9 per cent to 29 per cent of the total collections received under all national savings scheme in the country.
- Providing a fresh investment option from small investors, finance minister Arun Jaitley is set to re-launch the KVP. A hugely popular small saving product of the 1980s and 1990s, the KVP has been re-tailored and will be denomination of RS 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 50,000 and promises to double the investment in 100 months. There will be no upper limit on investments in KVPs that can issued in single or joint names and can be transferred from one person to other multiple times.
- The KVP will have a maturity period of eight years and four months but also offers flexible liquidity system under which investors can encash their certificates after he lock-in period of two years and six months or any time after that in any block of six months on predetermined maturity value.
- While initially KVPs will be sold only through post offices, it will later be available at designated branches of nationalised banks. They can also be transferred from on post office to another and can be pledge as a security against loans.
- Reintroduction of KVP is a welcome step not only in the direction of providing safe and secure investment avenues to the small investors but will also help in augmenting the savings rate in the country.
- It is revamped in the Budget to encourage people, who may have banked or unbanked savings to invest in formal saving products.    


## Kisan Vikas Patra back as safe haven for savings ##
a) What is KVP scheme:
- Government has opened up a new avenue of investment for small investors.
- Widely popular in the 1990s, the KVP is small saving product just like the National Savings Certificate(NSC) or the Public Provident Fund(PPF).
- At the time, it was largely considered as an avenue for those who did not have access to other saving scheme but now it can be interesting option for small investors, especially when other option such as gold has lost much of its shine with the various curbs on its important.

b) Salient features of scheme
- The scheme is also a new option for investment when the government has increased the tax saving limit under Section 80 C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 by RS 50,000 to RS 1,50,000. There is however no upper limit on investment into the scheme.
- The KVP, unlike what its name suggests is not just limited to the farmers but is open to all small investors.
- It will available to investors in the denominations of RS 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 50,000 and can be purchased at present from post offices. It will also be available at designated bank branches at a later phase.
- Investor will have to provide Know-Your-Customer(KYC) details on the lines of other small savings scheme, which is based on their risk profile or investment amount.
- A Permanent Account Number of the investor will be required in case of transaction over RS 50,000.
- According to norms issued, KVP would be in the form of a bearer bond. The certificated can be issued in single or joint names and can be transferred from one person to any other person, multiple times. The facility  of transfer from one post to another anywhere in India and of nomination will be available.
- The KVP also has a flexible liquidity system, which makes it more liquid than the NSC or the PPF which have strict lock in periods. While the KVP has a maturity period of eight years and four months, investors can encash their certificates after the lock-in period of two years and six months or any time after that in any block of six months on pre-determined maturiy value.

c) Pros
- It would help poor gullible investors to channelise their savings towards trusted government scheme instead of some Ponzi scheme.
- KVP can also be used as security and pledged for availing loans. 
- In terms of tax benefits, investment up to RS 1,50,000 annually will qualify for tax rebate. The interest income at the time of withdrawal will however be taxable.

d) Cons
- The product shows slight difference with regard to its interest rate. Unlike other small saving schemes, where the interest rate is now revised annually from April 1 based on market rates, the KVP will have a fixed interest rate.
- While it promises to double the investment amount in 100 months, its interest rate works out to about 8.5 per cent annually. This is indeed lower than the return offered by comparable small saving schemes such as PPF which has interest rate 8.7 per cent and the 10 year NSC that has an return of 8.8 per cent.

e) Future of scheme
- From 2015-16, the return on the KVP will seem more attractive compared to other small savings product.
- Interest rates in the bond markets are going down. This will translate into lower returns even for small saving products next fiscal. This is when the KVP will shine through.


## As banks plan more charges, reduce your ATM dependence ##
a) What is RBI directive:
- As per the directive issued by the Reserve Bank of India(RBI), the number of free transactions(inclusive of financial and non-financial) at your ATMs of your own bank has been limited to 5 in a month (as against unlimited free transactions till now.)
- In case of other bank's ATM, the number of free transactions have been brought down from five to three(in the six metros) while it has been kept at 5 for non-metros.
- The six cities that RBI has identified as metros for the same are - Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad.
- Banks are advised that at least five free transactions(inclusive of financial and non-financial) per month should be permitted to the savings bank account customer for use of own bank ATMs at all locations. The RBI directive has put a cap of Rs 20(plus service tax) as charge for every additional transaction.

b) The Impact:
- If you live in one of the metros and visit your ATM once in two days to withdraw cash then you will exceed your monthly free withdrawal limit (including own and other bank ATM) by 7 times which means that you will have to pay a penalty of over Rs 140 in the month which comes to Rs 1,680 in a year.

c) Ways by which you can reduce your ATM visits:
- Most monetary transactions and a lot of non-financial transactions such as cheque book request, credit card payments, checking your account balance or generating a mini statement can be done by logging into the net banking account and customer can avoid visiting ATMs for such purpose.
- Some banks including HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis bank offer a missed call service for non-cash transactions where the customer can call a dedicated number from their registered mobile number following which an SMS is sent by the bank. Customer can use it for balance enquiries, checking mini-statements, cheque books and making account statement requests. All that a customer needs to do is to store the toll free numbers of his/her bank and call on it.
- Customer can also go for more debit card transactions rather than cash transactions as it reduces the need for cash withdrawals.


## Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Committee (FSLRC) ##
