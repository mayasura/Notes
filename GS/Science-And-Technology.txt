## IRNSS-1C ##
- It's a 27th consecutive success mission of the Indian Space Research Organization’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle launched the IRNSS -1C, the third in a series of seven Indian Regional Navigation Satellite Systems from Sriharikota.
- The launch of the 1425 kg IRNSS-1C on board the PSLV-C26 was carried out at 1.32 am from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, ISRO said in an official statement.
- “After a flight of about 20 minutes 18 seconds, IRNSS-1C Satellite, weighing 1425 kg, was injected to an elliptical orbit of 282.56 km X 20,670 km, which is very close to the intended orbit,’’ ISRO said.
- The first two satellites in the IRNSS series 1A and 1B were launched on the PSLV on July 02, 2013 and April 04, 2014 respectively. These satellites are functioning satisfactorily, ISRO said.
- The IRNSS is an independent regional navigation satellite system designed by ISRO to provide GPS type positioning  information in the Indian region and 1500 km around the Indian mainland.“ IRNSS would provide two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Services (SPS) – provided to all users – and Restricted Services (RS), provided to authorised users,’’ ISRO said.
- “A number of ground stations responsible for the generation and transmission of navigation parameters, satellite control, satellite ranging and monitoring, etc., have been established in as many as 15 locations across the country,’’ ISRO said.
- The next satellite in the series the IRNSS-1D is scheduled to be launched by PSLV by the end of the year. The entire IRNSS constellation of seven satellites is proposed to be put in place by 2015.

## Canal Solar Power Project ##
- The Canal Solar Power Project is a project launched in Gujarat, to use 19,000 Kilometre long network of Narmada canals across the state for setting up solar panels to generate electricity. The 10 Megawatt project is situated on the Narmada branch canal near Chandrasan village of Kadi taluka in Mehsana district. The pilot project will generate 1.6 million units of clean energy per annum and also prevent evaporation of 9 million litres of water annually from the canal. The project virtually eliminates the requirement to acquire vast tracts of land and limits evaporation of water from the 750 meter long canal, tackling two challenges simultaneously by providing energy and water security.
- It is 3.5 kilometre-long country's biggest 10-MW canal-top solar power project. A total 483 solar tablets of 6.5X2.3 metres have been laid along the canal top which promises clean and green energy.


## A Rocky Landing ##
- European Space Agency's lander, Philae, was successfully launched from the Rosetta spacecraft and was fast dropping towards the comet 67P/Churymov-Gerasimenko. The historic mission is the first time anyone has attempted to land a spacecraft on a comet.
- For the next seven hours, Philae will descend 22 km, reaching its target on the "head" of the comet around 4pm GMT.
- ROSETTA WHO: Launched in March 2004, Rosetta was reactivated after a record 957 days in hibernation. Composed of an orbiter and lander, Rosetta's objectives are to study comet 67P in unprecedented detail, using its 21 scientific instruments to study how the comet reacts to a close encounter within sun. The resulting data will help scientists learn more about the origin and evolution of our solar system and the role comets may have played in seeding Earth with water, and perhaps even life.
- THE COMET 67P: Rosetta made history in August when it entered 67P's orbit. Surface temperature go down to minus 70 degrees and the terrain is uneven, making for a rough landing.
- THE MISSION: The first phase will last tow-and-a-half days where Philae will be on primary battery power. In phase two, which will use solar power for approximately three months. Its goal is stick which the comet until it passes the sun in August 1025.
- LANDING PHILAE: The landing site - previously known as "Site J" is named Agilkia. As it approaches the 67P, Philae will fire a set of harpoons and tether itself to the frozen surface.
- THE FAMOUS SELFIES: The Comet Infrared and Visible Analyser (CIVA) on Philae is comprised of seven cameras that are capable of taking 360 degree photos of the comet's landscape once the spacecraft lands. On September 7, Rosetta took a selfie with CIVA camera from a distance of 50 km from the comet.
- THE NUMBERS: 100 kg - weight of probe; 10 feet long - length of Rosetta; 2 wing-like solar panels; 6 billion km - distance travelled to reach comet; 10 years - time taken; $1.68 billion - cost of Rosetta mission; 75% - scientist's estimate of chance of a successful landing
- The COMET itself is about 2.5 Miles (4 KM) long and orbits the sun every six-and-ad half years.

‘Akash’ missile is a medium range surface-to-air anti-aircraft defence system with a strike range of 25 km and can carry a warhead of 60 kg. It has the capability to target aircraft up to 30 km away and is packed with a battery that can track and attack several targets simultaneously. With its capability to neutralise aerial targets like fighter jets, cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles, defence experts compare ‘Akash’ to the similar weapons of many other advanced countries, the sources said.


## INS Vikrant ##
- Majestic-class aircraft carrier. Nicknamed 'The Mother' by aviators, Vikrant was built-in 1945 in Britain as part of WWII effort and commissioned into British Royal Navy as HMS (Her Majestry's SHihip) Hercules. Lort Mountbaten was instrumental in getting her to India. The deal was signed in 1957.
- The ship joined the Indian Navy in 1961. It was India's first aircraft carrier, at a time when India had only frigates, destroyers and other surface ships. It initial air wing consisted of British Sea Hawk fighters and French Alize anti-submarine aircraft, later followed by Sea Kings and Chetaks.
- The carrier is 704 ft in length and 128 ft in breadth. Height of the aerial mast(above mean waterline) is 116 ft. It's weight was 21,067 tonnes(gross); 15,350 tonnes(net). It had 13 decks and max speed was 28 knots.
- The carrier was able to carry 21 aircrafts, including Sea Harriers(jet fighters), Sea Kings(search and rescue helicopters, anti-submarine warfare helicopters), Alizes(recce aircraft, used for anti-submarine and electronic welfare), Sea Hawks(jet fighters)
- L70 guns (fixed gun positioned on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier).
- 1,500 men and 200 officers as crew.


## KOSMOS Satellite ##
- A Russian satellite called 'Kosmos 2499' has been whizzing around the Earth, sneaking up close to other satellites, sometimes paying them a visit. It is a satellite killer ? A Spy ? Or a nosy space vehicle ? Countries like the US are spooked, reviving fears of the Cold War.
 
a) The Kosmos
- On May 23, 2014, Russia launched a rocket mission from its Plesetsk Cosmodrome as part of what seemed like just another mission to add new communication satellite to the Rodnik satellite constellation. But while previous Rodnik launches carried three satellites, this one had fourth - Kosmos 2499. This has renewed fears that Russia is back to developing anti-satellite weapons, a programme thought to have been abandoned in 1980s.

b) Motive Suspect
- The satellite launched alongside Kosmos 2499 - Kosmos 2496, 2497 and 2498 - were meant for military communications. But 2499 has been veering off course, including making a visit on Ocober 28 to the Briz-M rocket stage that launched it.
- The US military initially thought the strange space object was "just debirs". The craft has also kept changing its orbit in ways that are far from normal for even spy satellites that usually do anything they can to conserve their finite fuel.

c) Is it a satellite killer ?
- It's the odd orbit manoeuvres that caught the attention  of space watchers. This is just the kind of moves satellite-killing spacecraft, or ASAT as they called, make. Their purpose is to knock out other satellites, by either crashing into them at high speed or manoeuvring up close to them and then destroying them with high kinetic-energy projectiles(pellets driven by compressed gas or shrapnel driven by explosive charges, or maybe just conventional bullets shot from a specially adapted gun).
- But technology such as this one need not always be hostile - it could also help service, fuelling or repair.

d) Cold politics
- In 1960s, the Soviet Union had an active ASAT programme, but this was abandoned as the Cold War came to an end. "However in 2010, with relations between the West and Russian space commander Oleg Ostapenko revealed that such weapons were being studied again".
- News of Kosmos 2499 comes as Russian relations with the West are at a new low. "Well, the fact that the Russians did not declare it as part of the payload clearly suggests that they wished to conceal its presence. It is highly unlikely they omitted mentions of it by  accident in order to avoid political fallout," says Steve Denton on Quora.

e) They did it too
- Recently, both the US and China carried out test similar to that carried out by Russia. On July 28, the US Air Force launched an experimental satellite called ANGELS to manoeuvre around the upper stage of the Delta 4 rocket that has launched it into orbit.
- The Chinese Shijan 15 satellite, launched on July 19, 2013, has repeatedly shadowed Shijan 7, and older Chinese satellite.
- In 2007, China tested a ground-to-air missile to destroy a defunct weather satellite. The shot caused international opprobrium and the resulting shower of 30,000 pieces of debris is still troubling spacecraft.
 - The International Space Stations needs to change orbit regularly to avoid it. The US air force X-37B space plane, which spends many months om mystery mission, may have the ability to inspect, if not destroy satellites.
