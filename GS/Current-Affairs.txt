## Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) ##
- The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act in India came into existence in 1971. It was amended in 2003 to facilitate better implementation and increase access for women especially in the private health sector. However, even four decades after the Act came into effect, unsafe abortions are a reality.
- This act allows non-allopathic medical practitioners like ayurveda and homoeopathy specialists and paramedics like nurses and midwives to perform MTP's.


## Dengue Vaccine ##
- Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an "Aedes aegypti" mosquito infected with a dengue virus.
- France-based drugmaker "Sanofi Pasteur" has announced the world's first dengue vaccine could come in the second half of 2015.
- Overall efficacy against any symptomatic dengue disease was 60.8 percent in children and adolescents between ages 9 and 16 who received three doses of the vaccine. Analysis had shown a 95.5 per cent protection against severe dengue and an 80.3 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization during the study.
- Why is a dengue vaccine needed ? Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a virus, with four strains. The mortality associated with the virus is seen from the complication called Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF), characterised by sharp drop in platelets. With no specific treatment available for this condition, the management of dengue has been largely preventive, through anti-mosquito activities, ro symptomatic, where doctors treat patients for the symptoms.
- How will the vaccine work ? Sanofi Pasteur's tetravalent vaccine has been made with live attenuates of each strain of virus in a restricted and controlled amount, which is expected to just trigger body's immune response system to a level where immunity is developed, but the strain does not actually cause the disease. When the body encounters the virus in the atmosphere, it is expected that the immunity which has been exposed to the virus in controlled amount, will trigger the same protective response system.
- How big a threat is dengue to India ? According to WHO, dengue threatens over 2.5 billion people worldwide, including an estimated 500,000 who are hospitalized every year from the disease. Between 2 and 3 of every 100 people who contract dengue end up dying from it. According to large study published in 2013, in 2010, an estimated third of all dengue infections were in India, and the situation has worsened since. According to Health Ministry data, the number of dengue cases jumped 500 percent from 12,561 in 2008 to 75,808 in 2013, while the number of deaths from the disease more than doubled from 80 in 2008 to 193 in 2013. Western and southern India, Delhi and West Bengal are the dengue hotspots in India. In 2013 most cases were reported in Kerala(7,938), followed by Orris(7,132) and Karnataka(6,408). The most deaths, however, occured in Maharashtra(48), followed by Kerala(29) and Punjab(25). Both the disease and deaths are, however, suspected to be under-reported, and some experts feel the incidence of dengue in India could be up to 300 times higher.

## Basmati rice variety ##
- Pusa-1509 a basmati rice variety. Pusa-1509's advantage is its yield. The average 25 quintals paddy per acre from the variety are away above 10 quintals from tradition basmati varities such as Taraori and Deharaduni. It surpasses even the 20 quintals for Pusa-1121. 
- Both Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509 have lower plang heights than the 160 cm levels for traditional basmatis, making them more responsible to fertiliser applications. The Pusa-1509 plant is only 80 cm tall, below even the 120 cm for Pusa-1121.
- But the yield is not sole attraction. Pusa-1509 matures within 120 days while Pusa-1121 matures within 145 days.

## Loop holes from coastal security ##
Need to address following problems:
- String of new police stations along the coast
- Electronic Identification System
- Deployment of state-of-the-art interceptor boats.
- Fast boats in slow lane
- Badly designed equipment
- Poor planning and lack of training

- Digital Identification
- Global Positioning System sets fitted on most fishing boats could have been linked to control stations, just like taxi and truck fleets now have.

## Crude oil price failing ##
Reasons
=======
- Demand slowdown in Europe and China, increased shale oil production in the US, cutting down demand from OPEC crude, and the move by some OPEC members such as Kuwait and Iraq to offer deeper discount.
- United States imported 60 per cent of its oil need in 2005, it came down significantly in 2013 to 34 per cent of its total energy consumption.

What does crude price fall mean for india ?
- Every $1 per barrel decline in crude prices brings down the current account deficit by about $1 billion and a decline of close to $40 per barrel in Brent crude price over the last five months will be significant both for fiscal and current account deficit and growth in the economy. The dip in prices benefits the oil marketing companies significantly in terms of under-recoveries. In May 2014 when Brent hovered around $110 per barrel the daily under-recoveries of OMC stood RS 318 crore. With the decline in global prices, this came down to RS 188 crore for the first half of November 2014 even after the companies reduced the retail fuel prices. A dip in domestic fuel prices impacts the WPI inflation as it has a weightage of 9.3 per cent to the index. Fuel price inflation which hovered above 10 per cent till June 104, started slipping since then and it stood at zero for the month of October. This will also act as a factor for the RBI in taking a call on interest rate cut in its forthcoming monetary policy review on December 2.

What will happen if oil falls below $70 per barrel ?
- Oil at $70 per barrel may provide the much needed comfort to the Centre when it is looking to meet the fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent for 2014-15. Savings from lower crude oil prices will bring down the fuel subsidy bill for the government. Experts feel that it would also provide government to push for productive expenditure next year which may push growth in the economy. The Union Budget had allocated RS 63,427 crore as fuel subsidy in 2014-15(taking crude oil price at $110 per barrel and the rupee at 61 against the dollar for calculating the Budget Estimates). The trend in oil prices shows that any shortfall on revenue side at the end of the fiscal may be met through savings on oil subsidy front.
