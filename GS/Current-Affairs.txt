## Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) ##
- The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act in India came into existence in 1971. It was amended in 2003 to facilitate better implementation and increase access for women especially in the private health sector. However, even four decades after the Act came into effect, unsafe abortions are a reality.
- This act allows non-allopathic medical practitioners like ayurveda and homoeopathy specialists and paramedics like nurses and midwives to perform MTP's.


## Dengue Vaccine ##
- Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of an "Aedes aegypti" mosquito infected with a dengue virus.
- France-based drugmaker "Sanofi Pasteur" has announced the world's first dengue vaccine could come in the second half of 2015.
- Overall efficacy against any symptomatic dengue disease was 60.8 percent in children and adolescents between ages 9 and 16 who received three doses of the vaccine. Analysis had shown a 95.5 per cent protection against severe dengue and an 80.3 percent reduction in the risk of hospitalization during the study.
- Why is a dengue vaccine needed ? Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a virus, with four strains. The mortality associated with the virus is seen from the complication called Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF), characterised by sharp drop in platelets. With no specific treatment available for this condition, the management of dengue has been largely preventive, through anti-mosquito activities, ro symptomatic, where doctors treat patients for the symptoms.
- How will the vaccine work ? Sanofi Pasteur's tetravalent vaccine has been made with live attenuates of each strain of virus in a restricted and controlled amount, which is expected to just trigger body's immune response system to a level where immunity is developed, but the strain does not actually cause the disease. When the body encounters the virus in the atmosphere, it is expected that the immunity which has been exposed to the virus in controlled amount, will trigger the same protective response system.
- How big a threat is dengue to India ? According to WHO, dengue threatens over 2.5 billion people worldwide, including an estimated 500,000 who are hospitalized every year from the disease. Between 2 and 3 of every 100 people who contract dengue end up dying from it. According to large study published in 2013, in 2010, an estimated third of all dengue infections were in India, and the situation has worsened since. According to Health Ministry data, the number of dengue cases jumped 500 percent from 12,561 in 2008 to 75,808 in 2013, while the number of deaths from the disease more than doubled from 80 in 2008 to 193 in 2013. Western and southern India, Delhi and West Bengal are the dengue hotspots in India. In 2013 most cases were reported in Kerala(7,938), followed by Orris(7,132) and Karnataka(6,408). The most deaths, however, occured in Maharashtra(48), followed by Kerala(29) and Punjab(25). Both the disease and deaths are, however, suspected to be under-reported, and some experts feel the incidence of dengue in India could be up to 300 times higher.

## Basmati rice variety ##
- Pusa-1509 a basmati rice variety. Pusa-1509's advantage is its yield. The average 25 quintals paddy per acre from the variety are away above 10 quintals from tradition basmati varities such as Taraori and Deharaduni. It surpasses even the 20 quintals for Pusa-1121. 
- Both Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509 have lower plang heights than the 160 cm levels for traditional basmatis, making them more responsible to fertiliser applications. The Pusa-1509 plant is only 80 cm tall, below even the 120 cm for Pusa-1121.
- But the yield is not sole attraction. Pusa-1509 matures within 120 days while Pusa-1121 matures within 145 days.

## Loop holes from coastal security ##
Need to address following problems:
- String of new police stations along the coast
- Electronic Identification System
- Deployment of state-of-the-art interceptor boats.
- Fast boats in slow lane
- Badly designed equipment

## Crude oil price failing ##
Reasons
=======
- Demand slowdown in Europe and China, increased shale oil production in the US, cutting down demand from OPEC crude, and the move by some OPEC members such as Kuwait and Iraq to offer deeper discount.
- United States imported 60 per cent of its oil need in 2005, it came down significantly in 2013 to 34 per cent of its total energy consumption.

What does crude price fall mean for india ?
- Every $1 per barrel decline in crude prices brings down the current account deficit by about $1 billion and a decline of close to $40 per barrel in Brent crude price over the last five months will be significant both for fiscal and current account deficit and growth in the economy. The dip in prices benefits the oil marketing companies significantly in terms of under-recoveries. In May 2014 when Brent hovered around $110 per barrel the daily under-recoveries of OMC stood RS 318 crore. With the decline in global prices, this came down to RS 188 crore for the first half of November 2014 even after the companies reduced the retail fuel prices. A dip in domestic fuel prices impacts the WPI inflation as it has a weightage of 9.3 per cent to the index. Fuel price inflation which hovered above 10 per cent till June 104, started slipping since then and it stood at zero for the month of October. This will also act as a factor for the RBI in taking a call on interest rate cut in its forthcoming monetary policy review on December 2.

What will happen if oil falls below $70 per barrel ?
- Oil at $70 per barrel may provide the much needed comfort to the Centre when it is looking to meet the fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent for 2014-15. Savings from lower crude oil prices will bring down the fuel subsidy bill for the government. Experts feel that it would also provide government to push for productive expenditure next year which may push growth in the economy. The Union Budget had allocated RS 63,427 crore as fuel subsidy in 2014-15(taking crude oil price at $110 per barrel and the rupee at 61 against the dollar for calculating the Budget Estimates). The trend in oil prices shows that any shortfall on revenue side at the end of the fiscal may be met through savings on oil subsidy front.

## An Island Marooned (Katchatheevu island) ##
The AIADMK raised Katchatheevu in Parliament this week, demanding its return to Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka.
Arun Janardhanan recalls the history of the disputed island.

a) Where is Katchatheevu island ?
A 285-acre uninhabited speck in the Palk Strait northeast of Rameswaram, 33 km from the Indian coast, but within the maritime boundaries of Sri Lanka. About 4,000 devotees from Rameswaram visit the 110-year-old St Anthony’s Church on the island every year on average.

b) What is the island’s history ?
The island is the product of a 14-century volcanic eruption. It was controlled by the Ramnad zamindari centred in Ramanathapuram, and became part of the Madras Presidency during the Raj. In 1921, both the Indian and Sri Lankan territories of Britain claimed Katchatheevu in order to determine fishing boundaries. A survey marked Katchatheevu in Sri Lanka, but a British delegation from India challenged this, citing ownership of the island by the Ramnad kingdom. The dispute was never settled.

c) Is there an official agreement now ?
In 1974, an agreement was signed in two parts — on June 26 in Colombo and June 28 in New Delhi. The island was ceded to Sri Lanka, but Indian fishermen were allowed access to Katchatheevu “hitherto”. The agreement did not specify fishing rights, and Sri Lanka interpreted it as the right of Indians to access the island “for rest, drying nets and for visit to the Catholic shrine without visa”.

d) What happened after that ?
After Emergency was imposed in 1975 and the Tamil Nadu government dismissed in 1976, a series of letters were exchanged between the foreign secretaries of India and Sri Lanka. Both Parliament and the state Assembly were non-functional and, without consulting either, another agreement was drafted that said, “The fishing vessels and fishermen of India shall not engage in fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Sri Lanka.” While the 1974 agreement was to settle the maritime boundary in the Palk Bay, the 1976 pact was to determine the boundary in the Gulf of Mannar and Bay of Bengal.

e) When did matters flare up again ?
In 1991, the Tamil Nadu Assembly again sought retrieval of Katchatheevu and restoration of fishing rights of Tamil fishermen. As long as Sri Lanka remained preoccupied with its war against the Tamil Tigers, things remained calm. The northern province and maritime boundaries were not guarded tightly, and Indian trawlers routinely entered Sri Lankan waters. In 2003, Sri Lanka announced that it could consider allowing licensed fishing by Indian boats, but neither Tamil Nadu nor the Centre submitted a proposal. In 2009, the war with the LTTE ended, and things changed. Colombo beefed up its maritime defences, and when Indian fishermen — facing a depletion of marine resources on their side —  entered Sri Lankan waters, arrests followed, only to trigger fresh demands in Tamil Nadu for restoration of Katchatheevu to it.

f) How did things reach the Supreme Court ?
In 2008, ADMK leader J Jayalalithaa filed a petition saying Katchatheevu could not be ceded to another country without a constitutional amendment. The petition argued the 1974 agreement had affected traditional fishing rights and livelihoods of Indian fishermen. After becoming chief minister in 2011, she moved a resolution in the Assembly and, in 2012, went back to the Supreme Court asking her petition be expedited in the wake of increasing arrests of Indian fishermen by Sri Lanka.

g) Where do other parties stand ?
The Congress has always been defensive about the role of Indira Gandhi’s government in handing Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka. Before the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP endorsed the demand of Tamil parties to restore the island to the state. BJP leaders promised to take measures to revisit the agreement with Colombo.

h) Will the Centre keep that promise ?
In August 2014, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the Supreme Court that the matter was closed, and it would require “war” to get the island back. “Katchatheevu went to Sri Lanka by an agreement in 1974. It was ceded and now acts as a boundary. How can it be taken back today? If you want Katchatheevu back, you will have to go to war to get it back,” he said.


## Question Of Conversion ##
Amid chaos in Parliament over alleged forced religious conversions in Agra, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday called for central and state anti-conversion laws.

a) What does the Constitution say on freedom of religion?
Articles 25-30 guarantee citizens freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion. They also guarantee freedom to manage religious affairs, monetarily contribute to promotion of any religion, and to set up and administer educational institutions.

b) Was there a law on conversion before Independence?
The British did not enact any law. But many princely states did. Examples: Raigarh State Conversion Act, 1936, Patna Freedom of Religion Act, 1942, Sarguja State Apostasy Act, 1945, Udaipur State Anti-Conversion Act, 1946. Specific laws against conversion to Christianity were enacted in Bikaner, Jodhpur, Kalahandi and Kota.

c) What happened after Independence?
In 1954, Parliament took up for consideration the Indian Conversion (Regulation and Registration) Bill. Six years later, another law, the Backward Communities (Religious Protection) Bill, 1960, was proposed to stop conversion. Both were dropped for want of support. However, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh passed anti-conversion laws in 1967, 1968 and 1978 respectively. Later, similar laws were passed by the state assemblies of Chhattisgarh (2000), Tamil Nadu (2002), Gujarat (2003), Himachal Pradesh (2006), and Rajasthan (2008). The laws were intended to stop conversions by force or inducement, or fraudulently. Some of the laws made it mandatory to seek prior permission from local authorities before conversion.

d) What offences do forced conversions attract?
These laws made forced conversion a cognisable offence under sections 295 A and 298 of the Indian Penal Code, which pertain to malicious and deliberate intention to hurt the religious sentiments of others. They attract a prison term of up to three years and fine. The punishment, in some cases, is harsher if the offence is committed against a minor, a woman or an SC or ST person.

e) What legal challenge have these laws faced?
The first major case in which the Supreme Court ruled on the freedom of religion and on conversions related to petitions challenging the conversion laws of Orissa and MP in 1967-68. In 1977, a constitution bench headed by then Chief Justice of India A N Ray upheld the validity of the laws, saying freedom to propagate one’s religion, as stipulated under Article 25 (1), did not grant a fundamental right to convert another person. The bench ruled that a purposive conversion would impinge on the “freedom of conscience” guaranteed to all citizens.

f) What are the other significant judgments on conversion?
In the Sarla Mudgal case (1995), the Supreme Court held that conversion to Islam was not valid if done only in order to be able to practise polygamy. It was held to be an act of bigamy prohibited u/s 17 of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and punishable under Section 494 IPC. The second marriage would be void, the SC observed. This position was reaffirmed by the judgment in the Lilly Thomas case (2000), which clarified that prosecution for bigamy was not a violation of the freedom of religion under Article 25.
In the Vilayat Raj case (1983). the court said that if both parties were Hindu at the time of marriage, provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act can apply even after one of them or both converted to Islam.
In the Chandra Sekaran case (1963), the court had observed that a person does not cease to be a Hindu merely because he declares that he has no faith in his religion, or if he stops practising his religion.

g) When was the last attempt made at a central legislation?
In 1978, an All India Freedom of Religion Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha. However, it was never discussed, and was dropped after the government fell in July 1979.
