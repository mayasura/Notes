## Chapter 1: The Universe ##
0) Important words: glitter = twinkle.
 
1) The circumference of the Earth is 40,075 km.

2) The stars are self-illuminating. The Sun is also a star and has its own light. Sun is the nearest star to the earth. Sun is very bright during the daytime. Due to the brightness of the Sun, we cannot see the stars. You can probably observe that as the Sunlight fades during the evening, the stars begin to glow.

3) The stars that twinkle at night are several million kilometres away from the Sun. Their light is hidden from us because of the
brightness of the Sun’s light. Hence we do not see the stars during the day.

4) Light year: we use 'light year' for measuring the distance between the Earth and the stars. The distance that light travels in one year is known as the 'light year'. A light year is approximately 9.5 thousand billion (or million-million) kilometres. The speed of light is 300,000 kilometres per second. A light year is equal to 9,460,800,000,000 km (that is, 60 sec. x 60 min. x 24 hrs x 365 days x 300,000 km).

5) The light from the Sun, which is also a star nearest to the Earth, takes 8.3 minutes to reach the Earth. Likewise it is possible to measure the distances to all other stars from the Earth using the time it takes for the light to reach the Earth from each of them. One of the stars nearer to the earth is the star 'Proxima Centauri'. It is 4.3 light years away from the Earth.

6) The galaxy that the solar system belongs to is known as the Milky Way. The number of stars differs from galaxy to galaxy. Likewise, the shape of the galaxies vary as well. The Milky Way galaxy has a spiral shape. In the outer ring are the Sun and the eight planets. The light of the stars in the Milky Way appears like a giant white ribbon and hence it is known as Milky Way.


## Chapter 2: The Sun ##
0) Important words: innumerable = countless; Spectacular = amazing or worthy of special notice.

1) The Sun is the main source of energy. The life gets evolved and multiplied on the earth because of Sun’s energy. Temperature at the surface of the Sun is 6,000 degree Celsius and the temperature at the centre of the Sun is more than 15,000,000 degree Celsius.

2) The Sun is a mixture of gases. It consists of 92% of hydrogen, 7.8 % of helium and 0.2 % of other gases. The Sun converts 600 million tons
of hydrogen into 596 tons of helium every second. The Sun shines as a consequence of the fusion of hydrogen into helium, which is constantly taking place in its core. The heat energy thus released illuminates the Sun. Hence the space scientists have named the Sun as a “Big Fire Ball” of the universe.

3) The solar family consists of eight planets namely Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their satellites; Asteroids, Meteorites and Comets. All the planets in the solar family are controlled by the gravitational force of the Sun. These planets revolve around the Sun in their respective paths while spinning on their own axis.

4) The Sun with its planets revolve around the Milky Way Galaxy. The Milky Way Galaxy moves with innumerable galaxies in the Universe.

5) There are thousands of rock fragments called Asteroids revolving the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. They range from 1km. to 800km. in
diameter. These rock fragments are also called the “Flying Mountains” of the Universe.

6) Meteor: Colliding with one another, the asteroids come within the earth’s gravitational force. Due to gravitational force the asteroids are pulled towards the earth. When they pass through the earth’s atmosphere at a high speed, they get burnt due to friction. Such a burning
asteroid is named as Meteor or “Shooting Star”.

7)Meteorites: Large asteroids do not burn up completely when they pass through the atmosphere. Portions of these rocks that are not burnt dash against the surface of the earth and produce large depressions. Such rock fragments are called the Meteorites. A very large meteorite dashed and created a depression in Arizona, USA. The space scientists believe that the depression might have been formed at about 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. This huge depression is about 1.2 km. across and 170 metres deep. Over 30 tons of iron fragments have been found in the immediate area.

8) Comets: A comet is a feature with a coma and a long tail made up of dust particles. Comets are the most spectacular objects one could see in the solar system. Where do they come from ? The comets originate beyond Pluto and are being pulled towards the Sun by the gravitational force of Jupiter. They are made of frozen gases due to low temperature that holds together small pieces of rock and metallic materials. Such frozen objects are referred to as “Snowballs” of the universe. When such a snowball approaches the Sun, solar energy begins to vaporise the frozen gases, producing a glowing head called the Coma. From coma dust particles are pushed away by the radiation pressure of the Sun. Then the solar wind moves dust particles for a greater distance and this gives it the appearance of a tail. This feature is called the Comet. Some comets develop a tail that extends for millions of kilometres.

9) Halley's comet: It was in 1682 that Edmond Halley saw the comet that was to be named after him. He believed that this comet appears once in every 76 years. His prediction came true when it appeared on 1758. But Halley died before the return of the comet as he calculated. This comet reappeared in 1986 and is predicted that it will appear again in the year 2062.


## Chapter 3: The Solar Family ## ============> Read from space.com
0) Important words: distant = far off; swift = fast, quick, rapid; proximity = nearness.

1) There are eight planets including the Earth in the solar family. The planets Mercury and Venus are positioned in between the Sun and the Earth. They have very high temperatures because they are very near to the Sun. The other planets namely, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are positioned far away from the Sun and these planets have very low temperatures.

2) The planets can be classified into Rocky planets and Gaseous planets based on their composition. Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are smaller in size. These planets are composed mostly of dense rocks with small amount of gases. Hence, these are called Rocky planets. The Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are bigger in size. These planets are composed mostly of gases with small amount of rocks. Hence, these planets are usually called Gaseous planets. Pluto is very cold because of its distant position from the Sun. The average temperature of Pluto is about -210 0 Celsius. This temperature is cold enough to solidify any gas that might be present. Consequently, Pluto is described as an Ice Ball.

3) Mercury: The first planet positioned near the Sun is Mercury. Hence, the day temperature in this planet rises to a maximum of 350 degree Celsius. This temperature is roughly six times higher than the maximum temperature of the Earth. Likewise at night the temperature goes down to a minimum of -170 degree Celsius. This planet is unable to hold the heat it receives during the daytime because of the absence of a shield like Earth’s atmosphere. This is the swiftest planet of the solar family.

4) Venus: Venus is positioned second from the Sun and it is next to Mercury. The maximum temperature of this planet is about 480 degree Celsius. This planet records the highest degree of temperature in the entire solar system. Because of its proximity to the Earth, Venus can usually be seen before dawn as the “Morning Star” in the eastern sky. Likewise, after Sunset the same planet shines as brightly as an “Evening Star” in the western sky. This planet rotates from east to west.

5) Earth: Earth is positioned third from the Sun. The Earth is at a distance from the Sun that makes its position exactly where it should be to receive adequate heat energy conducive for the origin as well as for the growth of the living organisms. Water accounts for 71 per cent and land 29 per cent of the total area of the Earth. There are seven continents and four oceans on the surface of the Earth. The seven continents are Asia, North America, Europe, Australia, Africa, South America, Antarctica. And the four oceans are Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arctic ocean.
 The blanket of air that envelops the Earth is the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, Nitrogen accounts for 78 percent, Oxygen 21 percent and other gases including Carbon-Di-Oxide accounts for only 1 per cent. Water vapour and dust particles are also present in the atmosphere.
 The land, water, air and the favourable climate facilitate the origin of life and help them in their development on the Earth. Thus the Earth is also known as Living Planet. No other planet of the solar family has life like that of the Earth.

6) Mars: Mars is positioned fourth from the Sun. As it is far from the Sun, about 23 degree Celsius temperature prevails during day and about -101 degree Celsius during night. Dry rivers, extinct volcanoes, stony deserts, snow covered poles are discovered on the surface of this planet. Though these features look similar to those of the Earth, they do not possess a greenery like the Earth’s. The researchers believe that only dry landscape is present all over this planet. High amount of iron oxides are found in the soils and the rocks of this planet. There are stormy winds with a speed of 270 km/hour that blow for months together. They create a dusty layer making the planet appearing red.

7) Jupiter: Jupiter is positioned fifth from the Sun. It is very cold because of its distance from the Sun. Though it is the biggest planet of the solar family, it is only one tenth of the size of the Sun. It has almost perpendicular axis. It rotates on its axis with an inclination of about only 2 degree and hence the planet does not have any season like the Earth.

8) Saturn: Saturn is positioned sixth from the Sun. It ranks second in size next to Jupiter. There are seven rings around this planet. This
planet, with its 7 multi-coloured rings, appears very elegant. Cyclonic winds of 1500 km/hour blow on this planet.

9) Uranus: Uranus is positioned seventh from the Sun. Its axis is tilted about 98 0 to the vertical plane. It rolls on its sides while revolving
around the Sun but it does not spin as a top like other planets.

10) Neptune: Neptune is positioned eighth from the Sun. This planet has not completed a single orbit of the Sun since it was identified in
the year 1846. The scientists believe that it will complete its first orbit only in the year 2010.

11) Pluto: Pluto is the smallest and also the farthest planet of the solar system. The distance between the Sun and the Pluto is 40 times greater than the distance between the Sun and the Earth. Pluto sometimes moves inside the orbit of Neptune. From 1979 to 1999 Neptune became temporarily the farthest known planet. Since its discovery in the year 1930, Pluto has completed less than one fifth of its orbit around the Sun.

12) Uranus and Neptune are much bigger in size than the Earth. They appear in blue because of the presence of methane gas in their atmosphere.

13) Below table describes rotation and revolution period of planets:
=========================================================
Planet		Period of Rotation		Period of Revolution
=========================================================
Mercury		58 days and 12 hours	88 days
Venus 		243 days				224 days
Earth 		24 Hours				365 days and 6 hours
Mars 		24 days and 12 hours	687 days
Asteroids	--						--
Jupiter 	10 Hours				12 Years
Saturn		10 3⁄4 Hours			29 1⁄2 Years
Uranus		17 1⁄4 Hours			84 Years
Neptune 	16 Hours				165 Years
Pluto 		6.4 days				248 Years
==========================================================

14) Among the planets of the solar family, except for Mercury and Venus the rest have satellites of their own.

15) Jupiter is the swiftest rotating planet and the slowest is Venus. Mercury is the swiftest revolving planet while the slowest is Neptune.


## Chapter 4: The Moon ##
0) Important words: scorch = a discolouration caused by heat; rug = rough.

1) All the planets in the solar system except Mercury and Venus have satellites of their own. Earth and Pluto have one satellite each. Other planets have more than one satellite. These satellites revolve around their respective planets. The Moon is the only natural satellite of the earth. The Moon is smaller than the Earth but bigger than Pluto. Although the Sun is much bigger than the Moon, the Moon is much closer to the Earth, so it appears to be the same size as the Sun.

2) Like Earth, its satellite the Moon also rotates on its own axis. It takes 27.3 days to complete one rotation and also the same 27.3 days to complete one revolution around the earth. Thus the Moon rotates at exactly the same speed as that of revolution around the earth, which means that the same portion of the Moon is always seen from Earth. The Russians first showed us the other side of the Moon. In October 1959, their Luna 3 spacecraft sent pictures of the unknown backside of the Moon to Earth.

3) There are many interesting features such as mountains; plateaus and very broad low craters that are seen on the surface of the Moon. A peak (10,660m.) higher than Everest (8848m.) is found on the surface of the Moon. Huge craters are present in the Moon. Even Sun’s light cannot penetrate through the walls, of such craters. The Moon has no atmosphere like the atmosphere that envelops the earth. Hence, temperature of about 100 0 Celsius during the day and temperature of about -173 0 Celsius at night prevail on the Moon.

4) The Moon does not produce its own light like the earth and other members of the solar family. But it looks bright because it reflects light from the Sun. The Moon light is so comfortable to us, and does not scorch us like Sun, Why ? The amount of light reflected depends on the nature of the surface of the reflector. For example, when light falls on the surface of a mirror, it reflects completely and hence it looks very bright. But a rough surface like an iron plate, reflects less light and looks dull. The surface of the Moon is very rugged and therefore reflects less light from the Sun . What we appreciate in the night sky as Moon light is nothing but the reflected light of the Sun.

5) New Moon: When the Moon is in between the Earth and the Sun, the side of the Moon facing the Earth is dark as shown in the diagram (labelled 1) The Moon cannot be seen from the Earth. We call this the New Moon because it begins a new cycle of phase. 

6) Full Moon: When the Earth is in between the Sun and the Moon, the side facing the Earth is illuminated as shown in the diagram (labelled 5). We call this Full Moon, even though we see only the half hemisphere of the Moon at a given point of time.

7) Crescent: Halfway in between New Moon and Full Moon as shown in the diagram (labelled 3 & 7), only half of the near side of the Moon is reflecting the sunlight. So we can see only one-quarter of the Moon. We call these phases as Crescents. A crescent Moon that looks like a “C” is shrinking. If it looks like a “D”, then it is growing. The Moon always grows or shrinks from right to left.

8) Waxing: After New Moon day the Moon grows and appears like a crescent in the sky. This crescent continues to grow larger, approaching first quarter. As it grows further and appears larger than a quarter it is called gibbous. Gibbous grows into a Full Moon. The Moon shines brightly in the sky on Full Moon day. When the Moon is getting bigger every day (New to Full) it is waxing.

9) Waning: After Full Moon day, the Moon begins to shrink, becoming first a gibbous. The gibbous further shrinks, approaching second quarter. As it shrinks further and appears less than a quarter, it is a crescent Moon. It continues to shrink until it becomes invisible at New Moon day. When the Moon is getting smaller (Full to New) it is waning. It takes 291⁄2 days for the Moon to go through all its phases starting from Full Moon to New Moon .

10) The Eclipse: Sun is the only source of light for both the Earth and Moon. Eclipses occur when the light thus received is either blocked by the earth or by the Moon. When the Earth and Moon facing the Sun directly have their shadow falling in the space. Eclipses occur when either the Earth moves behind the Moon’s shadow or the Moon moves behind the Earth’s shadow.

11) Why Eclipses do not occur on all New Moon as well as on Full Moon days ?
The reason behind this is that the orbit of the Moon around the earth is tilted about 5 degree than the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. Thus mostly the Moon moves beyond the shadow of the Earth. Likewise the Earth also moves beyond the shadow of the Moon. But on rare occasions the Moon passes through the shadow of the Earth and the Earth passes through the shadow of the Moon due to the time difference in their rotation. At such times the Sun, Earth and Moon are aligned in a straight line. Only when the Sun, Earth and Moon are aligned in a straight line, an eclipse occurs.

12) The Lunar Eclipse: Lunar eclipses occur only when the following conditions are met.
	a) The Sun, Earth and Moon must be aligned in a straight line.
	b) The Earth must be positioned between the Sun and the Moon.
	c) The Moon must be in its full phase (Full Moon).
While revolving around the earth, the Moon travels through the earth’s shadow zone and loses its illumination slowly. The Moon takes totally 3 hrs 30 minutes to move away from the earth’s shadow, of which total eclipse may extend only up to 100 minutes. Such an eclipse is known as “total lunar eclipse.” In such occasion the Moon displays orange colour in the sky. Why ? During the eclipse the Moon reflects only the dim light from the earth and so it appears to be orange in colour. In general, the lunar eclipses occur twice in a year. Some years it may occur once or thrice. Sometimes there will not be even a single eclipse in a year. Lunar eclipses are not dangerous to our eyes. So just find a clear spot on the terrace or outside your house and enjoy witnessing the lunar eclipse.

13) The Solar Eclipse: Solar eclipses occur only when the following conditions are met.
	a) The Sun, Earth and Moon must be aligned in a straight line.
	b) The Moon must be positioned between the Sun and the Earth.
	c) Must be a New Moon day.
The Earth moves through the Moon’s shadow zone when the Moon is directly opposite to the Sun. Moon is positioned in between the Sun and Earth. In such occasion the shadow of the Moon sweeps over the face of the Earth. No sunlight reaches the earth’s surface. Such an eclipse is known as “Solar Eclipse.”

14) Total Solar Eclipse: The Moon is smaller than the Earth. Hence, the shadow of the Moon covers only a small portion of the Earth. People living in such a narrow shadow zone only can observe the eclipse in total. The total solar eclipse may not be visible for the people who live outside this narrow shadow zone. The earth takes 24 hrs. to rotate on its axis where as Moon takes 27.3 days to rotate on its axis. Because of this relative motion of the Earth and Moon, the shadow moves rapidly over the Earth’s surface. A total solar eclipse thus lasts for less than eight minutes at any one place on Earth. The earth is in total darkness for those eight minutes.

15) Annular Eclipse: The Earth revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit. So the distance between Earth and Sun changes slightly during the course of a year. When the Sun is closest to the Earth and the Moon is farthest away, the Moon does not completely cover the Sun. The Moon is also much smaller in size so that the rim of the Sun is visible around the edge of the Moon. The Moon hides the centre of the Sun and the rim of the Sun is visible around the edge of the Moon. This type of eclipse is known as an “Annular Eclipse.” In general solar eclipses occur two to four times a year. In rare instances five eclipses may occur in a year. Do not see the solar eclipse directly with naked eye. It will seriously affect your eyes.


## Chapter 5: Latitudes and Longitudes ##
0) Important words: 

1) The earth is very big in its size. The total surface area of the earth is about 510 million square kilometre. This total surface is covered by land and water. The continents constitute the land surface and oceans constitute the water surface.

2) You are writing a letter to your friend. If you want that letter to reach your friend what do you do ? You write his/her address on that envelope. Such an address alone helps the postman to locate your friend on the surface of the earth. Similarly we need addresses for locating the places on the earth. Hence geographers have designed imaginary lines as addresses to locate the places on the earth. Such lines are called the latitudes and the longitudes.

3) Latitudes: Latitudes are imaginary lines that are drawn from east to west as parallels on the globe. Do we see these lines on the surface of the earth? No. We cannot see them on the surface because they are imaginary lines drawn by the geographers. The 0 degree latitude drawn from east to west which runs across the globe is the equator. Equator divides the globe into two equal halves. The northern half of the equator is the Northern hemisphere and the southern half of the equator is the Southern hemisphere. The parallel lines north of the equator are called the north latitudes and those that are south of the equator are called the south latitudes. North Pole is the 90 degree N. latitude and South Pole
is the 90 degree S. latitude.

4) Important Latitudes: The 23 1⁄2 degree N. latitude is known as the Tropic of cancer and the 23 1⁄2 degree S. latitude is named as the Tropic of Capricorn. Similarly 661⁄2 degree N. latitude is known as the Arctic Circle and 66 1⁄2 degree S. latitude is known as the Antarctic Circle.

5) Longitudes: We know that the 90 degree N. is the North Pole and 90 degree S. is the South Pole. The imaginary line that joins both the north and south poles is called longitude. We know that the 0 degree latitude divides the globe into two equal halves. Similarly, the 0 degree longitude divides the globe into two equal halves. The eastern half, east of 0 degree longitude is called the eastern hemisphere and the western half, west of 0 degree longitude is called the western hemisphere. Which is considered as 0 degree longitude ? There is an astronomical research institute in Greenwich, a place near London. The longitude that is drawn across Greenwich has been taken as the 0 degree longitude. This 0 degree longitude is also called the Greenwich Meridian. Totally there are 360 longitudes drawn on the globe. To the east of Greenwich meridian 180 longitudes are drawn. They are 0 degree to 180 degree east longitudes in the eastern hemisphere. Similarly in the western hemisphere there are 0 degree to 180 degree west longitudes. The 180 degree E and 180 degree W longitudes are one and the same longitude.

6) On the globe 0 degree and 360 degree longitudes are one and the same longitude. Similarly 180 degree E and 180 degree W longitudes are one and the same longitude.

7) India's latitudinal extension: Cape Comorin is the southern tip of India. The 8 degree N. latitude runs along the border of Cape Comorin. The northern limit of our country is Jammu and Kashmir. The 37 degree N. latitude runs along the border of Jammu and Kashmir. Hence the latitudinal extension of India is from 8 degree N. latitude to 37 degree N. latitude.

8) India's longitudinal extension: The state of Gujarat is the western limit of our country. The 68 degree E longitude runs along the border of Gujarat. The eastern limit of our country is Arunachal Pradesh. The 97 degree E longitude runs along the border of Arunachal Pradesh. Hence, the longitudinal extension of India is from 68 degree E. Longitude to 97 0 E. Longitude.
