## The Earth in the Solar System ##
===================================
Celestial bodies: The Sun, the moon and all those objects shining in the night sky are called celestial bodies.

Stars: Some celestial bodies are very large and hot. They are made up of gases. They have their own heat and light, which they emit in large amount. These celestial bodies are called stars. For instance Sun is star.

Planets: Some celestial do not have their own hit and light. They are lit by the light of stars. Such bodies are called planets. The word 'planet' comes from Greek word 'planetai' which means 'wanderers'.

Constellations: Different patterns formed by group of stars. Ursa major or Big Bear is one such constellation. One of the most easily recognisable constellation is the 'Small Bear' or 'Saptarishi'. It is a group of seven stars that forms a part of the large 'Ursa Major' Constellation.

Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus have rings around them. These are belt of small debris. These rings may be seen from the earth with the help of the powerful telescope.

Astronomers: Those who study celestial bodies and their movement are called astronomers. 'Aryabhatta' was the famous astronomer of the ancient India.

Orbits: All the eight planets of the solar system move around the sun in fixed path. These paths are elongated and called orbits.

Till recently (August 2006), Pluto was also considered a planet. However in the meeting of the International Astronomical Union, a decision was taken that Pluto like other celestial bodies (Ceres, 2003 UB313) discovered recent past may be called 'dwarf Planets'.

Solar System: The Sun, eight planets and some other celestial bodies called asteroids and meteoroids form the solar system.
-  The Sun: The sun is in the centre of the solar system. It is huge and made up of extremely hot gases. It provides the pulling force that binds the solar system. The sun is the ultimate source of heat and energy for the solar system. Sol in Roman mythology is 'Sungod'. Solar means related to Sun.

- Planets: An easy way to memorise name of the planets in order of their distance from the sun is:

1) Mercury: It is nearest to the sun. It takes only about 88 days to complete one round along its orbit. It takes 59 days to complete a spin on axis. It is about 58 million km away from the sun. It spins in anti-clock wise direction.

2) Venus: It takes 255 days to complete one round along its orbit. It takes 243 days to complete a spin on axis. It is about 108 million km away from the sun. It is considered as 'Earth's-twin' because its size and shape are very much similar to that of the earth. It spins in clock wise direction. 

3) Earth: It takes 365 days to complete one round along its orbit. It takes 1 day to complete a spin on axis. It is about 150 million km away from the sun. It has 1 moon. In size, it is fifth largest planet. It is slightly flattened at the poles. That is why, its shape is described as a 'Geoid'. Geoid means an earth like shape. From outer surface, it appears blue because its two-third surface is covered by water. It is, therefore, called a 'blue planet'. It spins in anti-clock wise direction.

4) Mars: It takes 687 days to complete one round along its orbit. It takes 1 days to complete a spin on axis. It is about 228 million km away from the sun. It has 2 moons. It is also called as a 'red planet'. It spins in anti-clock wise direction.

5) Jupiter: It takes 11 years, 11 months (about 12 years) to complete one round along its orbit. It takes 9 hours 56 minutes to complete a spin on axis. It is about 778 million km away from the sun. It has 16 moons. It spins in anti-clock wise direction.

6) Saturn: It takes 29 years, 5 months to complete one round along its orbit. It takes 10 hours 40 minutes to complete a spin on axis. It is about 1427 million km away from the sun. It has about 18 moons. It spins in anti-clock wise direction.

7) Uranus: It takes 84 years to complete one round along its orbit. It takes 17 hours 14 minutes to complete a spin on axis. It is about 2869 million km away from the sun. It has about 17 moons. It spins in clock wise direction.

8) Neptune: It takes 164 years to complete one round along its orbit. It takes 16 hours 40 minutes to complete a spin on axis. It is about 4496 million km away from the sun. It has 8 moons. It spins in anti-clock wise direction.

Moon: Earth has only one satellite. Its diametre is only about one-quarter that of the earth. It is about 3,84,400 km away from the earth. The moon moves around the earth in about 27 days. It takes exactly the same time to complete a spin on axis. As a result, only one side of the moon is visible to us on the earth. It is called synchronous rotation of moon. The moon does not have conditions favourable for life. It has neither air or water. It has mountains, plains and depressions on its surface. These cast shadow on the moon's surface. We can observe these shadows by looking at the full moon. From above the North Pole of the Earth, the Moon will appear to revolve counter clockwise around the Earth. From below the South Pole of the Earth, the Moon will appear to revolve clockwise around the Earth. 

Inner planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars are called inner planets because they are very close to the sun. They are made up of rocks.

Outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune are called outer planets because they are very-very far from the sun. They are huge and made up of gases and liquids.

Light travels at the speed of about 300,000 km per second. Yet even with this speed, the light of the sun takes about 8 minutes to reach the earth.

Satellite: Satellite is a celestial body that moves around the planet in the same way as the planets move around the sun. A Human-made satellite is an artificial body. It is designed by scientists to gather information about the universe of for communication. It is carried by the rocket and placed in the orbit around the earth. Some of the Indian satellites in space are INSAT, IRS, EDUSAT etc.

Asteroids: Apart from stars, planets and satellites, there are numerous tiny bodies which also move around the sun. These bodies are called asteroids. They are found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Scientist are of the view that asteroids are part of a planet which exploded many years back.

Meteoroids: The small pieces of rock which move around the sun are called meteoroids. Some times these meteoroids come near the earth and tend to drop upon it. During the process due to friction with the air they get heated up and burn. It causes a flash of light. Sometimes a meteor without being completely burnt, falls on the earth and creates hollow.

Galaxy: Galaxy is a huge system of billions of stars, and clouds of dust and gases. There are millions of such galaxies that make the Universe.


## Globe: Latitudes and Longitudes ##
=====================================
Equator: It is an imaginary circular line which divides earth into two halves Southern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere respectively.

Parallels of latitude: All parallel circles from equator up to the poles are called parallels of latitude. Latitudes are measured in degrees.

The equator represents the zero degree latitude. Since the distance from the equator to either of the poles is one-fourth of a circle round the earth, it will measure 1/4th of the 360 degrees i.e. 90 degrees. Thus 90 degrees south latitude makes South Pole and 90 degrees north makes North Pole.

By measuring the angle of the pole star from your place, you can know the latitude of your place.

Important parallels of latitude:
1) 0 degree: equator
2) 90 degrees N: north pole
3) 90 degrees S: South pole
4) 23 and 1/2 degrees N: tropic of Cancer (in northern hemisphere)
5) 23 and 1/2 degrees S: tropic of Capricorn (in southern hemisphere)
6) 66 and 1/2 degrees N: Arctic Circle
7) 66 and 1/2 degrees S: Antarctic Circle

Heat zones of the earth
1) Torrid Zone: The mid-day sun is exactly overhead at least once a year on all latitudes in between the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of the Capricorn. This area, therefore receives maximum head and is called Torrid Zone.

2) Temperate zone: The mid-day sun never shines overhead on any latitude beyond the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of Capricorn. The angle of sun's rays goes on decreasing towards the poles. As such, the areas bounded by the tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle in Northern Hemisphere and the tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic circle in Southern Hemisphere have moderate temperatures. These are, therefore, called Temperate Zone.

3) Frigid zone: Areas lying between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole in the Northern Hemisphere and the Antarctic Circle and the South Pole in the Southern Hemisphere, are very cold. It is because here the sun does not rise much above the horizon. Therefore its rays are always slanting and provide less heat. These are, therefore, called Frigid Zones(very cold).

Meridians of longitude: The line of reference running from North Pole to the South Pole are called meridians of longitude and distance between them are measured as 'degrees of longitude'. Each degree is further divided into minutes, and minutes into seconds. They are semicircle and distance between them decreases steadily polewards, until it becomes zero, where all the meridians meet. 

Prime Meridian: Unlike parallels of latitude, all meridians are of equal length. Thus, it was difficult to number the meridians. Hence, all countries decided that the count should begin from the meridian which passes through Greenwich, where the British Royal Observatory is located. This meridian is called Prime Meridian. Its value is 0 degree longitude and from it we count 180 degree eastwards as well as 180 westward. The Prime Meridian and 180 degrees meridian divides the earth into two equal halves, the Eastern Hemispheres and the Western Hemisphere. 180 degrees East and 180 degree West meridians are on the same line.

Why standard time is required ?
The local time of places which are on different meridian are bound to differ. For example it will be difficult to prepare a time-table for trains which cross several longitudes. In India, for instance, there will be a difference of about 1 hour and 45 minutes in the local times of Dwarka(62 degrees E) in Gujarat and Dibrugarh(97 degrees E) in Assam. In India the longitude of 82 degrees 30 E is treated as standard meridian and it is known as Indian Standard Time(IST).

Some countries have great longitudinal extents so they have adopted more than one time standard. For example, in Russia, there are as many as eleven standard times. The earth has been divided into twenty-four time zones of one hour each. Each zone thus covers 15 degree of longitude.
