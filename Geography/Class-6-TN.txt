## UNIT-I: The Universe ##
1) The starts that twinkle at night are several million kilometres away from the Sun. Their light is hidden from us because of the brightness of the Sun's light. Hence we do not see the starts during the day.

2) We use 'light year' for measuring distance between the Earth and the stars.

3) Light Year: The distance that travels light in one year is known as 'light year'. a light year is approximately 9.5 thousand billion kilometre. The speed of light is 300,000 kilometre per second. A light year is equal to 9,460,800,000,000 km i.e. (60 sec. x 60 min. x 24 hrs. x 365 days x 300,000 km). The light from the Sun, which also a star nearest to the Earth, takes 8.3 minutes to reach the earth.

4) One of the stars nearer to the Earth is 'Proxima Centauri'. It is 4.3 light years away from the Earth.

5) The Milky Way: The galaxy that the solar system belongs is known as the 'Milky Way'. The 'Milky Way' galaxy has a spiral shape. In the outer ring as the Sun and the eight planets. The light of the starts in the 'Milky Way' appears like a giant white ribbon and hence it is known as 'Milky Way'.
