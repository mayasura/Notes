1) Use "I am failed to understand" instead of "I am unable to understand"

2) Use "valid grounds" instead of "valid reasons"

3) Use "mull over" instead of consider

4) Use "with the aid of" instead "with the help of"

5) Reforms have to be people-drive and insulated from political process: Modi

6) The ministry of human resource development is fast becoming everyone's favourite punching bag again - and as it would appear, now without reason.
